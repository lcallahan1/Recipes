_1 packet yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)_
_1 cup warm water_
_2 1/2 cups flour_
_1 teaspoon honey_
_1 teaspoon salt_
_2 tablespoons olive oil_
_cornmeal_

_Preheat oven to 400F. In a large bowl, combine the yeast and warm water and stir until the yeast dissolves. Add the flour, salt, honey and olive oil; stir to combine using first a wooden spoon then your hands. Let dough rest for 10 minutes._

_Sprinkle baking sheet with cornmeal and press dough into it to your desired thickness. Top with your toppings and bake for approximately half an hour or until crust is golden, toppings are heated through and cheese is bubbly._

_Roasted Garlic Pizza_

_1 recipe Easiest Pizza Dough In The World_
_1 head garlic_
_olive oil_
_salt & pepper_
_shredded mozzarella cheese_
_oregano_

_Preheat oven to 400F._

_Keeping head of garlic whole, peel away loose papery exterior. Cut just the top off the whole head of garlic and discard. Place garlic on aluminum foil and drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Take up ends of foil to form a package around the garlic and roast in preheated oven for 20-30 minutes. Allow to cool slightly._

_Once garlic is cool enough to handle, unwrap from foil and place on cutting board (not wood, preferably). Using the non cutting edge of a knife, start at the un cut end of the garlic and press and squeeze the softened garlic from the head. Trim any tough tops and using the same knife, smear each clove against the board. The cloves will easily become a paste - roasting the garlic sweetens and softens it beautifully._

_Gather up the garlic paste and using a spatula, spread over the pizza dough. Top with shredded mozzarella and oregano. Bake according to pizza dough instructions above. Let cool just slightly before slicing and serving._
