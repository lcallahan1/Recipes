**Ingredients**
2 1/2 cups leftover mashed potatoes (I use twice baked-recipe follows)
1 1/2 cup shredded leftover fish (easier to shred at room temp)
1 egg
2 cups panko
1/2 tsp cracked black pepper (cracked not regular)
1/2 tsp cajun seasoning
sprinkle of paprika
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

**Twice Baked Potatoes:**
4-5 pound bag of golden yukon potatoes or 4 large russet potatoes; I leave skin on (this is your choice)
1/2 cup shredded Monterrey cheddar cheese
1/2 tsp salt and pepper each
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 cup green onions, chopped
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup sour cream
3 TBSP butter

**Directions**
Mash together your potatoes and fish. Add in the seasonings then the egg and panko. Mix well. Form into small patties, approximately 2-3 inches. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes or all day. I like to do this in the morning so I can can breathe as dinner approaches knowing I already have it all together.
In a large skillet over medium heat, add 1/4 cup oil. Once the oil is hot (you can drop a small crumb from your patties to see if the oil sizzles, if so, then you're ready) and pan-fry the patties 2-3 minutes on each side until they reach a golden brown. You might have to do this in batches of 3-4 patties as you don't want to overcrowd the pan. Serve hot and enjoy!

**For the potatoes**
Boil potatoes in a large stockpot until you can insert a fork easily into the center of a potato. Drain, toss in the butter, cheese, seasoning, sour cream, green onions and milk. Mash until everything is combined.
