**Hot Spinach Artichoke Dip, Picky Palate Style!**

1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 Cups fresh baby spinach leaves, chopped (or 10 oz of frozen spinach, thawed and drained well)
2 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1/2 Cup reduced fat mayonnaise (I felt a little better this way!)
8 oz softened cream cheese
1 teaspoon Tabasco Hot Sauce
Pinch of salt and pepper
1 Cup fresh grated parmesan cheese (go for the real stuff that you grate yourself, it makes a world of difference here, mmm!)
13 oz can artichoke hearts, drained and coarsely chopped
1 1/2 Cups shredded mozzarella cheese

1. Heat oil into a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook spinach for about 3 minutes or until it's wilted down. Stir in garlic for 1 minute then remove from heat. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add the mayonnaise, cream cheese, hot sauce, salt, pepper, parmesan and artichokes; mix until well combined. Pour into a small baker or 2 individual smaller bakers. Top with shredded cheese. Bake for 25-3o minutes or until hot and bubbly. Serve with favorite chips or sourdough bread, enjoy!
