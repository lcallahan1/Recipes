**Monkey Bread Bites with Sweet Cream Drizzle**

1 roll Pillsbury French Bread Loaf

6 Tablespoons Sugar

3 Tablespoons cinnamon

½ Cup butter, (1 stick)

½ Cup brown sugar

½ Cup powdered sugar

2-3 Tablespoons heavy cream

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove bread roll from packaging and carefully unroll so it is in a rectangle. Fold dough in half with long ends folded over each other; press edges slightly. With scissors, cut dough into ½ inch strips then cut each strip into ½ inch little cubes. Combine sugar and cinnamon into a large bowl. Gently toss all pieces of dough into sugar mixture.

2. Spray a 12 count traditional muffin pan with non stick cooking spray. Divide bread pieces into the 12 muffin cups with or without paper liners. Set aside.

3. Place butter and brown sugar into a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir until melted and bubbly. Pour evenly over each muffin cup.

4. Bake for 18-20 minute or until bread is cooked through. Remove from oven and let sit in pan for 5 minutes before transferring to cooling rack.

5. Place powdered sugar into a small bowl and slowly whisk in heavy cream until smooth and desired drizzling consistency. Drizzle icing over each little cup. Serve monkey bites warm or at room temperature. I ate them all day and they were good warm or room temperature.
