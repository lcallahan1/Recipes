Studels

2 sheets puff pastry, thawed

1 sleeve Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies

4 ounces softened cream cheese

1 egg white plus 2 teaspoons water

1/2 Cup powdered sugar

3 Tablespoons heavy cream

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  and line 2 baking sheets with parchment or silpat liners.

2.  Place Thin Mints in food processor and pulse until finely ground.  Transfer ground cookies to a medium bowl and add softened cream cheese.  Mix until well combined, I use my hands, it's much easier!  Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 rectangles totaling 18.  Spread cookie/cream cheese mixture over 9 rectangles then top with remaining 9, crimp edges with fork and poke a few holes on top to allow for steam to escape.  Whisk egg white and water and brush lightly over each strudel. Sprinkle tops with granulated sugar and bake for 25-30 minutes or until puffed and golden brown.  Remove and let cool for 5 minutes.

3.  Place powdered sugar and heavy cream into a bowl, mix until smooth.  Drizzle over warm strudels and serve.  Can be enjoyed chilled as well.
