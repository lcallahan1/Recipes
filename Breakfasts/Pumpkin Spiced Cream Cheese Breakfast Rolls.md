**Pumpkin Spiced Cream Cheese Breakfast Rolls**

2 packages/cans Pillsbury Crescent Rolls

4 0z cream cheese, softened

1/4 Cup brown sugar

1/4 Cup canned pumpkin (Libby's)

1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/8 teaspoon fresh ground nutmeg

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Unroll crescent rolls to form 4 rectangles placed side by side.  Pinch seams together to form one long rectangle.  Place cream cheese, brown sugar, pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg into a mixer; beat until well combined.  Spread mixture over crescents leaving a 1/2 inch border around edges.  Starting at long end, roll up then cut into 1 inch pieces.  Place around 2 9 inch cake pans that have been sprayed with cooking spray.  I left the centers open so the rolls form a circle.

2.  Bake for 28-30 minutes or until rolls are golden brown.  Remove and let cool for 10 minutes.  Frost warm rolls with cream cheese frosting recipe below.
