### [**Cinnamon Roll Cupcakes**](http://www.pink-parsley.com/2009/09/cinnamon-roll-cupcakes.html)

These cinnamon roll cupcakes are just too cute!  I took them to an early morning tailgate, and it was a great way to enjoy cinnamon rolls without the mess.  In the interest of full disclosure, I wasn't entirely happy with how they turned out, but it was all my own error. We were out at an alumni function Friday night, soI didn't start these until after 10pm Friday night; needless to say I was already really really tired... so I'm afraid I was just a little careless. I feel like I should have kneaded it by hand a few times before the first rise, because it was very very slow to rise. I actually stopped it about 45 minutes in, kneaded it a few times, then put it back... and miraculously, it rose! I then refrigerated the finished rolls overnight in lieu of the final rise, which was fine, but they actually didn't rise until they were in the oven. And finally, I overbaked them by about a minute. I thought they were a little dried out because of this, but my friends still enjoyed them!

Jen at [Beantown Baker](http://www.beantownbaker.com/) said that she had to re-roll each roll before putting it in the muffin tin, and I did too. No big deal though. It only took a few extra minutes. I also topped with a bit of cream cheese frosting, which I think is basically the best thing ever. And I may or may not have dipped a few leftover french toast kabobs in the extra frosting :-)

- 2 1/4 tsp. or 1 packet dry active yeast
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar, divided
- 1 cup warm milk (approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit)
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 1/3 cup butter, melted
- 1 tsp. salt
- 4 1/2 cups bread flour

- 1 cup brown sugar, packed
- 2 1/2 Tbsp. ground cinnamon
- 1/3 cup butter, softened

- 8 oz cream cheese, softened
- 2/3 cup butter, softened
- 1 1/2-2 cups powdered sugar

Dissolve the yeast and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar in the warm milk in a large bowl and let stand for about 10 minutes until foamy.

Mix in the eggs, butter, salt, and other 1/4 cup of granulated sugar. Add flour and mix until well blended and the dough forms a ball. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead about 5-10 times. Place in an oiled bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size (about one hour).

After the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon. Line cupcake pan with cupcake liners, and lightly spray over the top of them with cooking spray.

Roll dough into a 12x22 inch rectangle. Spread dough with 1/3 cup butter and sprinkle evenly with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough and cut into 24 rolls using dental floss or a pastry cutter. You may have to unroll each roll and re-roll in order for the dough to fit in a cupcake tin.

Place each roll in a cupcake liner. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Alternatively, allow to rise overnight in the refrigerator. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 10-12 minutes. Let rolls cool completely before frosting.

To make the frosting, mix cream cheese and butter using the whisk attachment of a mixer. Slowly add the powdered sugar until desired consistency has been reached.
