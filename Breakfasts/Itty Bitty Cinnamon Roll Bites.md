**Itty Bitty Cinnamon Roll Bites**

One can Pillsbury "Simply" refrigerated biscuits, 10 count

5 tablespoons softened butter

1/4 cup packed light brown sugar

2 teaspoons McCormick Gourmet Roasted Saigon Cinnamon

1 cup powdered sugar

5 to 6 tablespoons heavy cream

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. and line a large baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray.

2. Unroll biscuits onto a clean countertop and press out with fingers to about 3 inches wide. Spread each biscuit with 1/2 tablespoon of butter then top evenly with brown sugar and cinnamon. Starting at the bottom of each round, roll up jelly roll fashion with seam side down on countertop. Use a sharp knife and cut 1/2 inch slices and place onto prepared baking sheet. I cut 6 slices per biscuit making 60 small cinnamon rolls. Bake for 16 to 20 minutes, until light brown and cooked through. Remove from oven.

3. Place powdered sugar and heavy cream into a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Drizzle glaze over hot rolls. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving. Best served warm with a tall glass of milk!
