1 1/2 c. all purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. nutmeg

1/2 c. sugar
1/3 c. butter, melted
1 egg (preferably room temperature)
1/2 c. milk

Flax seed

**Topping**
1/2 c. sugar
1/2 c. butter, melted
1 tsp. cinnamon

Preheat oven to 350F.

In a medium-large bowl, sift together all dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients and stir until combined, but still a bit lumpy. Don't over mix. Scoop batter into muffin tins that have sprayed with cooking spray. Using a cookie/ice cream scoop, distribute batter for 10-12 muffins. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they just start to turn a bit golden at the edges.

For the topping, mix sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Place melted butter in another small bowl. Dip the warm muffins in melted butter, then in cinnamon sugar.
