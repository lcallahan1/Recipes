**Cookies and Cream Swirled Brownies with Chocolate Peanut Butter Ganache**

1 box Brownie Mix (9×13 size)
8 oz softened cream cheese
1/3 Cup sugar
10 Oreo Cookies, broken into pieces
1 Cup semi sweet chocolate chips
1 ½ Tablespoons creamy peanut butter
3 Tablespoons half and half

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare brownie mix according to package directions and place into a 9×7 inch baking dish that has been lined with tin foil and sprayed with cooking spray. \*\*I like a thicker brownie, so I use the smaller baking dish, but you can use the 9×13 inch size as well.\*\*

2. In a medium bowl, stir together the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Stir in Oreo Cookie pieces until combined. Using a spoon, spoon cookies and cream mixture evenly over brownie mix. Using a knife, gently swirl cookies and cream into brownies without scraping the bottom of the dish. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean from center. Cool completely.

3. Place chocolate chips into a microwave safe bowl and microwave for about 1 minute. Stir in peanut butter and stir chocolate chips until smooth. Place back in the microwave for 15-30 more seconds if not smooth. Stir in half and half until glossy smooth, then spread over cooled brownies. Cut into squares and serve.
