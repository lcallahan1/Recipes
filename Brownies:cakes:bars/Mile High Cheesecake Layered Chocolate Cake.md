Mile High Cheesecake Layered Chocolate Cake (adapted from Christmas with Southern Living 2007 cookbook)

1 box devils food cake mix
½ Cup oil
½ Cup water
8 oz sour cream
1 box chocolate instant pudding mix (4 serving size)
4 eggs
1 bag chocolate chips

1 Sara Lee Frozen New York Style Cheesecake (30 oz)

24 oz softened cream cheese
1 stick softened butter
½ can of pre-made vanilla frosting (I used the 16 oz Pillsbury)
16 oz powdered sugar

3 Piroline (rolled wafer cookies) cut into 1 inch pieces for garnish
½ Cup chocolate chips

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a stand or electric mixer, mix cake mix, oil, water, sour cream, pudding mix, eggs and chocolate chips for 1 ½ minutes. Pour into 2 greased 9 inch cake pans. Bake for 25-28 minutes or until cooked through. Remove, cool and refrigerate for a few hours.

2. Slice cheesecake into ½ inch cubes once it's thawed; set aside. Place cream cheese, butter and pre-made frosting into a stand or electric mixer. Beat until well combined. Slowly add powdered sugar until nice consistency. Refrigerate frosting for ½ hour to firm it up slightly.

3. Once cake has been chilled, remove from pans and slice each cake in half horizontally to make 4 layers. Spread layers with ½ Cup frosting then sprinkle with 1/3 of the cubed cheesecake pieces. Repeat this procedure until all 4 layers are on cake, leaving the top layer without cheesecake pieces. Frost top and sides of cake with the remaining frosting.

4. Arrange cookie pieces in center of cake for garnish. Place chocolate chips into a microwave safe bowl and heat for 30-45 seconds or until melted and smooth. Place chocolate in the corner of a ziplock baggie and snip the corner edge. Drizzle melted chocolate over top of cake. Refrigerate cake until ready to serve. Enjoy!
