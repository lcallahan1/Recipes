Turtle Brownies

2 Cups sugar
1 Cup butter, softened
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 Cup sour cream
6 Cups flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

1 brownie mix

10 Kraft caramels

1 Tablespoon milk

Crushed Pecans for topping

1. In an electric or stand mixer, cream the sugar and butter. Add eggs, vanilla and sour cream until well combined. Slowly add in the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt until well combined.

2. In 2 batches, place in plastic wrap in a disc shape and chill for at least 2 hours for best results.

3.  Prepare brownie batter according to package directions.  Place batter in freezer, to harden it up for about 20 minutes.

4. Once chilled, cut each disc into thirds and roll into a 1/8 inch thick oval, about 12 inches X 5 inches.   Pour about 1/4 Cup brownie mix over each oval.  Start rolling from the long end closest to you, rolling into a log shape.  Using a sharp knife, cut 1/2 inch pieces of dough then placing/folding into well greased mini muffin tins.  This step is really messy, the brownie will ooze everywhere.  Don't worry, they still bake up beautifully!  Bake at 350 degrees for 12-15 minutes.

5.  When cooled remove cookies from tins and place onto a cooling rack.  Melt caramels in microwave until melted and smooth.  Drizzle over top cookies then sprinkle with crushed pecans.  Serve with milk
