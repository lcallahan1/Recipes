I made a huge mess this afternoon in my oven making these cakes! Learn from my mistake and make this cake in a 9 x 13 inch baking pan rather than little cakes. The buttery cinnamon swirl ooozed out all over my oven making a huge smoky mess, so use the pan!!

This recipe is from my brother in law's very talented mother (Mrs. Adams). I always hear about the great food that she makes, so I finally bummed the recipe from my sister. I tasted this cake last year and loved it! It is a real treat. I'm just not going to try the cute little individual cakes next time!! Enjoy, this is a great recipe!

Buttery Cinnabun Cake

3 Cups flour
¼ teaspoon salt
1 Cup sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 ½ Cups milk
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 Stick real butter, melted

2 sticks real butter, softened
1 Cup brown sugar
2 Tablespoons flour
1 Tablespoon cinnamon
2/3 Cups nuts, optional

2 Cups powdered sugar
5 Tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon vanilla

1. In an electric or stand mixer mix the flour, salt, sugar, baking powder, milk, eggs and vanilla. Once combined well, slowly stir in melted butter. Pour batter into a greased 9 x 13 inch baking pan.

2. In a large bowl, mix the 2 sticks of softened butter, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon and nuts until well combined. Drop evenly over cake batter by the tablespoonfuls and use a knife to marble/swirl through the cake.

3. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until toothpick comes out nearly clean from center.

4. Place powdered sugar, milk and vanilla in a large bowl. Whisk until smooth. Drizzle over warm cake. Serve warm or at room temperature. Enjoy!
