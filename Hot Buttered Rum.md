**Hot Buttered Rum**

This drink is delicious, and approximately a trillion calories, so you won't want to drink too much of it...but that's ok, cause you're not gonna stay at this party long anyway, are you?



To make it at home, [Emeril says](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/hot-buttered-rum-cocktail-recipe/index.html) to

**cream together:**

 a stick of butter,

2 cups of light brown sugar,

a teaspoon of nutmeg,

a pinch of cloves,

and a pinch of salt.

Refrigerate this until almost firm, and then spoon 2 tablespoons of the mixture into 12 small mugs. Pour about 2 ounces of rum into each mug, and then top with boiling water.
