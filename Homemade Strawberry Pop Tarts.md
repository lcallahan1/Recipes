**Homemade Strawberry Pop Tarts**

_Ingredients:_

- Pie crust, refrigerated or homemade (see below)
- Jam or Preserves
- Glaze or Egg Wash
- Sparkling Sugar

_Directions:_

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. _(I went by the temp setting on the box, the original recipe calls for 450.)_

Unroll one of the pie crusts and square the edges. Cut into rectangles. Place 1 tsp of jam in the center of a rectangle and top with another piece of crust. Crimp all four edges. Repeat until all of the pie crust is used. I also took the rounded edges that I cut off and rolled them together to form more pop-tarts. They weren't as "pretty" as the others, but I hate to waste food.

Bake the pop-tarts for about 7 â€“ 8 minutes or until slightly brown. Once cool, pour glaze over and decorate with sugar. If you don't want to add extra sugar with the glaze, you can use an egg wash on the tops  with some white sugar.

Take one pie crust rectangle, fill with a tsp of jam. Cover with another piece of pie crust. Crimp all four edges. Repeat until you run out of pie crust. Bake at 450F for abou7-8 minutes or until slightly brown. Set aside to cool. Once cooled, pour glaze on to Pop-tart and decorate with sparkling sugar.

To Make the Glaze:

- 1 cup powder sugar
- milk to thin

Place powdered sugar in bowl. Pour milk slowly until it has a consistency of really thick syrup.
