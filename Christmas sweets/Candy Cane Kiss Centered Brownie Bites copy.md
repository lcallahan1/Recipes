**Festive Candy Cane Kiss Centered Brownie Bites**

1 brownie mix 9Ã—13 inch size

18 Candy Cane Hershey Kisses

1/2 Cup chocolate chips

2 Tablespoons heavy cream

3 original candy canes, crushed

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Prepare brownie mix according to package directions and scoop into a mini cheesecake pan or mini muffin tin pan that has been generously sprayed with cooking spray, about 3/4 way full.  Press kisses into center of brownie batter, do not push all the way to bottom, some of the tip should stick out the top.  Bake for 20-23 minutes or until brownies are cooked through.  Let cool completely.

2.  Melt chocolate chips in microwave 30 second intervals until smooth and melted.  Stir in cream until silky smooth.  You can place back in microwave for 10 seconds to smooth more if needed.  Dip tops of brownies into melted chocolate, then sprinkle with crushed candy canes.  Serve with a tall glass of milk.  Enjoy!!
