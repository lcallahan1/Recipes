  2 3/4 cup all purpose gluten free flour (with xanthan gum)

  1 2/3 cup granulated sugar

  1 tbsp  [GF Baking Powder](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P0I7T6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005P0I7T6&linkCode=as2&tag=yammsnosh04-20)

  ¾ + pinch salt teaspoon salt

  3/4 cup (12 tablespoons) softened salted butter

  1/2 cup vegetable oil

  5 egg whites, 2 yolks (2 eggs + 3 whites)

  1 1/4 cups buttermilk

  1 tbsp gluten free vanilla



  Preheat oven to 350ºF and grease and flour three 8 inch cake pans (I put a circle of parchment paper on the bottom of each pan to ensure easy removal). This would probably also make two 9 inch pans, one 9x13 inch pan or a  couple dozen cupcakes.

  Mix the flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt on low speed for a minute to fluff them up. Add the butter and oil and continue mixing for another minute until incorporated.

  Add the egg whites one at a time, beating well after each addition.

  Add the milk and vanilla a little at a time and then beat on high speed for two minutes. The batter should be thick and fluffy.

  Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake for about 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool completely before frosting.
