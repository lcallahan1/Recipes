24-36 cupcakes, 2 9 in layers

4 cups (480 to 500 grams) cake flour

2 teaspoons (10 grams) baking powder
1-1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1-1/4 teaspoon (5 grams) table salt

2-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon (heaped) ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground ginger
2 sticks (1/2 cup, 1/4 pound or 113 grams) unsalted butter, softened
2 cups (200 grams) sugar
1 tbsp (15­­­­­ ml) pure vanilla extract
4 large eggs, at room temperature
2 cups buttermilk (237 ml), well-shaken
3 cups grated peeled carrots



Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line with circles of parchment paper, then butter parchment.

Sift together dry ingredients in a medium bowl. In a large mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until pale and fluffy, then beat in vanilla. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well and scraping down the bowl after each addition. At low speed, beat in buttermilk until just combined (mixture will look curdled). Add flour mixture in three batches, mixing until each addition is just incorporated. Then, with a rubber spatula, fold in carrots.

Spread batter evenly in cake pan, then rap pan on counter several times to eliminate air bubbles. Bake until golden and a wooden pick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 10 minutes, then run a knife around edge of pan. Invert onto rack and discard parchment, then cool completely, about 1 hour.
