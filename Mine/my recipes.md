|   **Fettuccini Alfredo** ** (one pan!)** 8 oz (or so) fettuccini or penne **pasta** 1½ (approx) cups **mozzarella/parmesan cheese** mix1-1½ cups **light whipping cream** (or half-half, don't recommend heavy cream)1 clove **garlic** 1 tsp (approx) **Italian seasoning** ¼ tsp **black pepper** (or so, to taste)A pinch salt Cook pasta to "al dente" (not quite as firm as you'd like it to be), drain. Return pasta to pan and add cream and cheese. Over low heat, gently mix (with plastic or wooden spoon) as cheese melts. Add more cream or cheese to reach desired consistency.  Add garlic and seasonings. \*sauce will thicken as it sits, so you may need to add more cream later, or if you add too much don't worry because it will soak up if left over low heat.\ ***chicken variation :** sauté 1-2 white meat chicken breasts (cut into small chunks or slices) in oil and with the garlic and some seasonings over med-hi heat until fully cooked (5-10 minutes?).  Add to the pasta mixture after sauce is finished, or right before serving.  |
