# GF Chocolate Chip Cookies


Makes 1 1/2 dozen cookies

1-1/4 stick (unsalted) butter
3/4 cup + 2 tbsp brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg, plus 1 yolk
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1-1/2 tsp + a pinch salt
2 cup oat flour

1/4 cup + 2 tbsp coconut flour
1-2 cup chocolate chips

Preheat the oven to 375ÂºF.
Mix together the butter and sugars. The mixture will be slightly crumbly. Add the egg and vanilla and beat _until smooth_.
Mix together the soda, salt, and flour and add to the wet ingredients. Mix until incorporated. Add the chocolate chips.
Bake on ungreased baking sheets for 8-9 minutes or until the edges are just becoming golden. Definitely want the brown, but only around the very edge (bottom will be crispy and inside will be gooey) (TBSP scoop)
