Coconut Macaroons

3 Cups shredded sweetened coconut

1 tsp almond extract or vanilla

1/8 teaspoon salt

2/3 Cup sweetened condensed milk

1 teaspoon cream of tartar

2 egg whites beaten stiff

1/2 Cup chocolate chips melted for drizzling

1. Preheat oven to 350. Mix coconut, almond extract, salt, milk and cream of tarter in a large bowl until combined. Fold in egg whites. With a large cookie scoop, scoop onto a parchment or silpat lined baking sheet. Bake for 13-16 minutes or until edges and tops of cookies are golden brown. Let cool completely. Drizzle melted chocolate over cookies. I put the chocolate in a ziplock, snip the edge and drizzle it.

12-15 large cookies
