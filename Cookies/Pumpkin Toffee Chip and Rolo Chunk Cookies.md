**Pumpkin Toffee Chip and Rolo Chunk Cookies**

1 Box Yellow Cake Mix

One 15 ounce can Pumpkin (I used Libby's)

2 cups mini chocolate chips

1 cup toffee chips

1 1/2 cups chopped Rolo's

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. and line a large baking sheet with parchment or a silpat liner.

2. Place cake mix and pumpkin into a large bowl, mix to combine. Stir in chocolate chips, toffee chips and Rolo's, mixing until combined. With a medium cookie scoop, scoop dough onto prepared baking sheet about 1 inch apart. Bake for 15-17 minutes until cooked through. Remove from oven and let cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to cooling rack. Serve room temperature or chilled.
