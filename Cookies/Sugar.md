**Sugar / Snickerdoodles**

**About 2 dozen**

- **½** cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- **½** cup granulated sugar
- **¼** cup light brown sugar
- **2** teaspoons vanilla extract
- **1** large egg
- **1 ½** cup all-purpose unbleached flour (I use King Arthur)
- **½** teaspoon sea salt
- **¼** teaspoon baking soda
- **½** cup turbinado, or coarse sugar  (w/ cinnamon for snicks)
- **\*\*\* 1 tsp cinnamon + ¼ tsp cream of tarter for snickerdoodles**



1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 large sheet pans with parchment paper.
2. Cream butter and sugars for 2 minutes and scrape sides of bowl.
3. Add vanilla. Beat for 1 minute. Scrape sides of bowl.
4. Add egg. Beat for 1 minute. Scrape sides of bowl.
5. Add flour, salt and baking soda. Beat 1 minute. Scrape sides of bowl and beat for another minute.
6. Place course sugar in small, shallow bowl. Using a small cookie/ice cream scoop (mine is 1 ½" in diameter), scoop balls of dough and drop a few at a time in the course sugar and gently roll around. Place balls of dough on parchment, leaving about 1 ½" space around each. My pans fit 12 cookies very comfortably.
7. Bake for 8 - 10 minute.  (The tops don't get much color, but the bottoms will be nicely golden.)
