**Frosted Pumpkin Cookies**



1 box spice cake mix
1 box yellow cake mix
2 15oz cans pumpkin
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (fresh grated, preferably)
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

**Frosting**
1 tub vanilla frosting
4 oz softened cream cheese
1 Tablespoon William Sonoma Vanilla Spice Butter, you can leave out if you don't have it, but totally worth the trip.



1. Place cake mixes, pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon in a mixer and mix until well combined. With a cookie scoop, scoop onto a parchment or silpat lined cookie sheet. Bake @ 350 degrees F. for 11-13 minutes or until cooked through. Let cool completely.

2. Mix frosting, cream cheese and butter in a large bowl, spread on cooled cookies. These cookies are great cold! Enjoy!
