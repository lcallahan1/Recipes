**Easy Parmesan Knots**



- 1 tube (12 ounces) refrigerated buttermilk biscuits ( I used Pillsbury Golden Layers Refrigerated Buttermilk Biscuits)
- 1/4 cup canola oil
- 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (I did use the green can stuff)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes

1. Roll each biscuit into a 12-in. rope and tie into a knot; tuck ends under. Place 2 in. apart on a greased [baking](http://realmomkitchen.com/609/easy-parmesan-knots/) sheet. [Bake](http://realmomkitchen.com/609/easy-parmesan-knots/) at 400Â° for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.
2. In a large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; brush the warm knots with the mixture. **Yield:** 10 knots **.**
