A couple months ago, someone requested that I try my hand at caramel brownies. Amazingly, this person was not my husband, but he endorsed this idea so wholeheartedly that I suspect he might have paid this person off. Then again, in most people&#8217;s minds, who <i>doesn&#8217;t</i> want to make caramel brownies? What kind of strange person considers what would happen when sea salt-flecked deeply copper-colored homemade caramel meets a chewy, rich homemade brownie and then shrugs it off, &#8220;Eh, I&#8217;ll pass.&#8221; Guys, it&#8217;s me. It&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t think that a salted caramel brownie could be delicious, it&#8217;s just that I imagine it&#8217;s well-trodden territory, which to me translates as &#8220;people who want to make this already know how to&#8221; and then I figure my time would be better spent making other things, like <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/02/egg-salad-with-pickled-celery-and-coarse-dijon/">weird egg salads</a> and <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/01/ethereally-smooth-hummus/">silky hummus</a>. </p>

<p>But then, as I did a quick search or two, I discovered things that caused me to make that crooked face that I made when I&#8217;m thinking really hard, because sometimes after a day of explaining to a preschooler why we have to wear pants when we leave the apartment when I fully understand the desire to simply not wear pants sometimes, thinking <i>is</i> really hard. The first is that a whole lot recipes started with store-bought caramels or caramel sauce, which made me sad, because the homemade stuff requires three ingredients that you probably have, is really easy to make and the flavor comparison (especially if you add a fourth ingredient, salt) &#8230; well, there is none. They barely deserve to share the same name. The next thing that gave me pause was that they all looked achingly sweet, as if little consideration was given to the fact that dousing an already-sweet brownie with caramel sauce might cause teeth to hurt/dentists to buy new vacation homes. </p>

<p>By now, I already accepted that any further resistance would be futile. I mean, if you were to distill any given Smitten Kitchen blog entry into the simplest formula, most of the time it would roughly = 2 causes of furrowed brow/<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8452752541/in/photostream">piqued curiosity</a> + 1 polite request + 1 borderline-begging request + a notable absence of willpower. But as I got into the kitchen, I found a third source of drama, which was in how the caramel-brownie merger should be approached. Spreading half the batter in the pan, covering it with caramel, and then adding the second half of the brownie batter was kind of difficult, and the caramel filling all but disappeared into the brownie. A marbled attempt not only led to vanished caramel, but it left trenches in the brownie tops where the caramel had once been, like some sort of sad memorial. And the thing I realized was, if I&#8217;m going to eat something called a caramel brownie, what I&#8217;m really hoping for are parts instantly recognizable as either; I want the caramel to tangle around the brownie and vice-versa, not just dissolve into a caramel-flavored brownie. </p>

<p>The only idea I had left was the craziest one, wherein you kind of fake-make caramel candies that are cold and big enough that they take longer to disappear into the the batter than the batter takes to bake. The results, however, are madness, and I urge you not to make them. Why? Why take you this far only to send you home? Because no good can come of them. They&#8217;re ludicrously rich but not icky sweet, so it&#8217;s easy to forget that you should never, ever eat more than one. They&#8217;re so loud with dark chocolate and salted caramel flavors, they might even be better than either part. Worse, they&#8217;re structurally unsound. Those squares of caramel melt into puddles that trickle out when you slice them, leaving a weak, almost gooey, chocolate foundation behind. I mean, trickling salted caramel? Gooey chocolate? <em>Yuck</em>. It&#8217;s okay guys; I&#8217;m happy to audition these terrible things so that you do not have to. What a relief, right?</p>

<p><b>Salted Caramel Brownies</b></p>
<p>I used my standard approach to salted caramel, but I dialed back the heavy cream so that it would be less soft, and therefore better able to hold up in the batter. The brownie is <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2012/08/my-favorite-brownies/">my one-bowl favorite</a>, with less salt and sugar to compensate for the sweetness and extra salt in the caramel. The result is a soft, messy brownie that it much, much, much easier to cut neatly if placed in the freezer until semi-firm. </p>
<p>Makes 1 8×8 pan of brownies which you can cut into 16 2-inch squares, 25 smaller squares, 32 2×1-inch bites or a mess of hearts from a cookie cutter.</p>
<p><u>Caramel</u><br />
1/2 cup granulated sugar<br />
4 tablespoons unsalted butter (or salted, but then ease up on the sea salt)<br />
Heaped 1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt (or 1/8 teaspoon table salt, more to taste)<br />
3 tablespoons heavy cream</p>
<p><u>Brownie</u><br />
3 ounces (85 grams) unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped<br />
1 stick (4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, plus extra for pan<br />
1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar<br />
2 large eggs<br />
1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract<br />
Heaped 1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt or 1/8 teaspoon table salt<br />
2/3 cup (85 grams) all-purpose flour</p>
<p><em>Make caramel:</em> Set a square of parchment paper over a medium-sized plate. Lightly butter or coat the parchment with a spray oil, just as an added security measure. </p>
<p>In a medium, dry saucepan over medium-high heat, melt your sugar; this will take about 5 minutes, stirring if necessary to break up large chunks. By the time it is all melted, if should be a nice copper color; if not, cook until it is. Remove from heat and stir in butter. It may not incorporate entirely but do your best. Stir in cream and salt and return saucepan to the stove over medium-high heat, bringing it back to a simmer and melted again any sugar that solidified. Cook bubbling caramel for a few minutes more, until it is a shade darker. </p>
<p>Pour out onto parchment-covered plate and transfer plate to your freezer. Freeze until solidified, which can take anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes in a decent freezer to 40 minutes in my terrible one.</p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, or when your caramel is almost firm, make your brownies:</em> Heat oven to 350&#176;F. Line an 8×8-inch square baking pan with parchment, extending it up two sides. Butter the parchment or spray it with a nonstick cooking spray.</p>
<p>In a medium heatproof bowl over gently simmering water, melt chocolate and butter together until only a couple unmelted bits remain. Off the heat, stir until smooth and fully melted. You can also do this in the microwave in 30-second bursts, stirring between each. Whisk in sugar, then eggs, one at a time, then vanilla and salt. Stir in flour with a spoon or flexible spatula.</p>
<p><em>Assemble brownies:</em> When caramel is firm, remove it from the freezer and chop it into rough 1-inch squares. Gently fold all but a small amount of caramel bits into batter. Scrape batter into prepared pan, spreading until mostly even. Scatter remaining caramel bits on top. Bake in heated oven for 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. </p>
<p>Cool thoroughly &#8212; a process that can be hastened in the freezer, which will also produce cleaner cuts &#8212; and cut into squares or other desired shapes.</p>

				<p>As messy as those look, I just know I would feel compelled to &#8220;neaten them up&#8221; until there was nothing left in the pan. </p>
<p>I love your blog! Your recipes always seem appealing to me and I want to try every one. If you&#8217;re casting about for more ideas, though, I would love to see some recipes with that delicious big flake coconut that I just discovered at my organic market&#8230; I am a coco-nutter, and would love to try the SK recipe for that good stuff!</p>

				<p>WOW! looks amazing. I think I would just pour the caramel on top of the cooked brownies as a frosting, that way if I wanted to just eat the top with a few brownie crumbs I could. How many hours until I can get home and make these?! YUM!</p>

				<p>Oh, Deb. I am seven months pregnant and coincidentally a huge fan of both chewy brownies and salted caramel. I will be making these this weekend, and oh darn, eating for two. I may also let a scoop of really good, simple vanilla ice cream melt over the tops just a bit&#8230;</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to make a caramel brownie, but I really didn&#8217;t want to use store bought caramels. I thought caramel frosting, but I am a firm believer that even the chewiest of brownies becomes cake with the addition of frosting.</p>

				<p>Thank you for brightening my morning with this glorious post. Since the caramel only requires 3 tablespoons of heavy cream, do you think I might be able to get away with using half &amp; half (instead of purchasing a container of heavy cream the entirety of which would sadly go unused)?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m gonna attempt to make those but here&#8217;s what will happen: I&#8217;ll make the caramel, try to eat it (all) will cooking, burn my tongue, wait for the rest to cool off, eat the rest and then make chocolate brownies (without caramels).<br />
Any suggestion on how to solve this impasse?</p>

				<p>After meeting you in November, I&#8217;m finally getting up the courage to comment! Any more bouts of this kind of courage, and I might have to go have a bit of a lie down.</p>
<p>Your objections to most caramel brownies are the same as mine: too sickly sweet and the delicious flavors combine to make a meh flavor.  This is what makes your recipe so dangerous.  If you have the same general indifference to caramel brownies that I do, and you still love (or love-hate for how good it is) this recipe, then I probably will too!  Oh the horror.</p>

				<p>Only tangentially related to this post/these brownies, but I just have to say how happy I am to see all these posts lately! I know you&#8217;re heading back out on the road, so to speak, but I&#8217;m so happy to get a dip, salad, soup, pasta, and (two!) desserts to play with before you go. And, of course, the recipes I&#8217;ve bookmarked in your actual book :-)</p>

				<p>I make my own version of caramel brownies, with the requisite homemade caramel. They have been dubbed &#8220;Confession Brownies&#8221; by a individual who will remain nameless to protect all the innocent. Being a good Catholic that he is, after the first bite he said &#8220;Oh God, I think I need to go to confession now.&#8221; They are the cause of much rejoicing in certain circles when I make them. P.S. Try adding a teaspoon (or two) of soy sauce to your caramel in place of the salt. Just trust me :)</p>

				<p>I second #27&#8242;s question. Once these cool, does the caramel become hardened? I guess I really want to know if these will travel/be good the next day&#8230;if they don&#8217;t get eaten before then.</p>

				<p>I love that you made caramel and then worked it into the brownies in big, chunky, gorgeous pieces! Most people who make caramel brownies drizzle on some jarred ice cream topping but clearly that wouldn&#8217;t be your style and am glad you made this recipe rather than going with your “people who want to make this already know how to” logic. I love these!</p>
<p>And love that your brownies are super dense and fudgy and beyond rich looking!</p>

				<p>Thanks for perfecting the caramel brownie Deb! I recently tried a gluten free version at a friend&#8217;s place and had the same thought: this could be so much better if it wasn&#8217;t so sweet. And with the small amount of flour in the brownie portion of your recipe, this will be easily converted into the best gluten free caramel brownie!</p>

				<p>@jill kitchen</p>
<p>Heavy cream really makes caramel. The fat is needed. However, heavy cream can&#8217;t go to waste. Use it in eggs, make whipped cream, add it to anything you add milk. A little more decadent, but it won&#8217;t be wasted. Plus the stuff lasts forever.</p>

				<p>Amazing.  I&#8217;ve been looking for a salted caramel choc-chip cookie recipe all week and  was frustrated at every recipe that called for Kraft caramels (or store-bought).  Insanity that no one else bothered to make the caramel!<br />
What perfect timing this was &#8211; thank you!</p>

				<p>The French have a word, &#8220;mignon,&#8221; which translates roughly to adorable. And while I&#8217;m not a big chocolate fan, I am a slave to all things caramel, and when you make it heart shaped, well, très mignon!</p>

				<p>Oh, my gracious. I was just craving come brownies but I&#8217;m afraid to make these because I would eat the whole pan. I love making caramel &#8211; its like kitchen magic (much like making buttercream) and I think it is coo-coo-crazy that people would every resort to using store-bought.</p>

				<p>Deb, I have been searching for the right recipe for this, also having had my own struggles. Thank you so much! And Jasmine, on the margarine &#8211; don&#8217;t do it! Your caramel will seize up, I think because there is more water in margarine. I tried it and ruined a whole batch. Butter is the only way here.</p>

				<p>Deb, Will we get good results using your Best Cocoa Brownies (<a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/01/best-cocoa-brownies/" rel="nofollow">http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/01/best-cocoa-brownies/</a>) recipe here?  I love those brownies. They&#8217;re not overly sweet, so I thought they might be a good partner with the caramel.  More importantly, I have cocoa powder and no chocolate in my pantry.  Just want to make sure that there weren&#8217;t any issues before I start these.  I don&#8217;t want to waste ingredients. </p>
<p>Congratulations on your cookbook making it into the Piglet contest over at Food52.  Lovely accomplishment and acknowledgment of the quality of your book. That&#8217;s a great crowd you&#8217;re in with.  Best of luck.</p>

				<p>Hello! This looks *awesome*. Thank you!</p>
<p>I stopped by originally to comment that I had that &#8220;I wonder&#8230;&#8221; moment in a posh grocery store where I was buying dark chocolate discs to make your chocolate chip cookies. I picked up a bunch of their &#8216;peanut butter chips&#8217; and though &#8211; what would this be like with the one-bowl brownie recipe?</p>
<p>At home, I ate some of the chips and they were a little sweetish and not peanutty enough. So I modified your brownie recipe as follows, but I figured I&#8217;d give you my idea and let you have fun with it.</p>
<p>4 oz peanut butter chips<br />
2 TB butter (probably should have used 1)<br />
1/4 c peanut butter (Jif, if you&#8217;re curious)<br />
2/3 c sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
1 tsp salt<br />
1 tsp vanilla<br />
2/3 c flour</p>
<p>I sprinkled kosher salt on top because for me the ideal peanut buttery thing is peanut brittle&#8230; sweet and salty. The kosher sprinkles kinda disappeared but left their memory in the baked &#8216;brownie&#8217; top. My husband pronounced them wonderful, but they&#8217;re still not quite right to my mind. What would you change, I wonder? :)</p>
<p>Thank you for being you, and being wonderful. Peace.</p>

				<p>Swapping out heavy cream with half and half?  Any idea if that would ruin things?  Just trying to avoid going to the store.  :)</p>

				<p>Arguing with your preschooler about wearing pants literally made me laugh out loud in my cube. We regularly have to have this conversation with our 3 year old son &#8211;ug, boys!  Mine LOVES anything chocolate, so these will have to go on the &#8220;must bake&#8221; list, you know after I work myself through your cookbook.</p>

				<p>I was really hoping your next post would include chocolate.  I love making heart brownies but I&#8217;ve never liked the caramel sauce or whatever baked into a great chocolate brownie.  I like your approach to the caramel and now I have to try it.  Thank you so very much.</p>

				<p>and this is why i love smitten kitchen&#8230; i made some gorgeous-looking &#8216;salted caramel&#8217; brownies via pinterest &#8211; which sadly turned out to be &#8216;kinda-caramel-flavored-cheesecake-swirled-brownies&#8217; (why did i not realize that the large amount of cream cheese in the recipe would lead to that??)<br />
 i love the thought you put into this&#8230; will be making asap :)</p>

				<p>Caramel brownies are one of my specialties.  I started making them several years ago after have one at Fat Witch in Chelsea Market.  I do make my own caramel and do half the brownie batter, then the caramel layer, then the rest of the batter.  The trick is to make sure your caramel is thick enough to not dissolve into the brownie.  I like your method too.  The puddles of caramel look fantastic!</p>

				<p>Deb and Jasmine &#8211; YES I made caramel sauce from your Apple Tart recipe with Earth Balance Vegan Butter and it worked great! I assume it would work for this firmer caramel recipe as well. I also used Silk Soy heavy creamer. Vegan caramel that&#8217;s still delicious &#8211; who knew!</p>

				<p>i will be stopping by the store so that i can make this as soon as possible.</p>
<p>for those who are scared of making caramel, i&#8217;ve previously used thick (and cold) dulce de leche in Deb&#8217;s one bowl brownies, drizzling/swirling it haphazardly on top right before going in the oven, and had good results.</p>

				<p>My method for the merge of caramel and brownie was to cook the brownie for a little while before pouring the caramel over top. Worked pretty well but like you I had some issues with structural stability, especially towards the middle of the pan! Tasted great though!</p>

				<p>I was wondering what to do with that 100% cacao bar in my cabinet! Lucky enough to have time to make these as soon as I saw the recipe. They are in the oven now. Very straightforward recipe, although my caramel did not take as long as yours to finish. That also happened to me with your caramel popcorn. Maybe because I have an electric range? </p>
<p>Excited to see how they stack up vs the Knock You Naked Brownies which are great but toothache-sweet.</p>

				<p>Petra &#8212; Heavy cream and whipping cream can be used interchangeably most places, including here.</p>
<p>Eliza &#8212; Probably? I don&#8217;t see why not, but of course haven&#8217;t tried it.</p>
<p>Di &#8212; I don&#8217;t have a lot of experience mailing things, but I&#8217;d say these are definitely on the messier side. You can freeze them, but won&#8217;t that just buy you a few hours? They&#8217;re not going to go bad, though, or not quickly. They&#8217;ll just be messy.</p>
<p>Nic &#8212; Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Emily &#8212; I&#8217;d go with leveled quarter-teaspoons.</p>
<p>Half and half &#8212; I have, sadly, never tried to make caramel with it. Maybe someone who has will pipe up and let folks know if it&#8217;s worked for them? Thanks!</p>

				<p>Alice &#8212; They&#8217;re not going to go stale because they&#8217;re too moist. They might, however, go bad faster at room temperature due to all the moisture. I might keep them in the fridge. (In actuality, I keep them in the freezer because my husband and I adore frozen brownies!)</p>

				<p>I made the caramel sauce for your apple mosaic tart with 2 tablespoons of non-fat milk instead of the recommended heavy cream. It came out great for me. I wasn&#8217;t trying to make any &#8220;healthy&#8221; changes or anything. I just had non-fat milk and didn&#8217;t want to buy heavy cream. The caramel recipe here is nearly the same, so I am thinking that one could sub nearly any milk product for the heavy cream and have it turn out. Maybe I am wrong here, as I have never tried it, but I just wanted to share my experience. </p>
<p>Love your blog and the cookbook!</p>

				<p>Oh my sweet lord, Deb, I swear you&#8217;ve been reading my mind/dreams. This is EXACTLY the dessert I&#8217;ve been dreaming of the last few weeks! I have never made my own caramel, so I didn&#8217;t think of this, but I did add some peanut butter to your cocoa brownie recipe which staved off the craving for a minute, but now that these have come into my life I don&#8217;t think I can ever go back. THANK YOU!</p>

<p>Do you have a suggestion on what kind of flaky sea salt to use? I know you say that regular salt works as well, but I&#8217;d like to try the flaky sea salt &#8211; if only I can figure out what kind to get &amp; where to get it!</p>

				<p>I just made these and the caramel concept produces a better caramel brownie than many others I&#8217;ve tried and these are sooooo easy to make and even easier to eat.  Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>I really wish this post had existed earlier this week. I saw what looked like amazing Dulce de Leche Brownies on Pinterest and knew I needed them in my life, but ended up with the same issues you had, the dulce de leche just soaked into the brownies so you had no idea that it was there. These look like the perfect solution! I&#8217;m looking forward to re-testing the brownies using your recipe and hopefully they look as amazing as yours came out :).</p>

				<p>These look amazing! I am wondering if you have ever made whiskey brownies? I saw a recipe recently but the base was almost meringue and that sounded too insubstantial for me (whiskey doesn&#8217;t go with light in my book). Just thought I&#8217;d ask and perhaps you&#8217;d add it to your list of future posts :)</p>

				<p>If I loved my husband, if I truly truly loved him, I would make a pan of these this weekend.  </p>
<p>&#8230;and that&#8217;s how you justify making a sinful lot of brownies and eating half of it in one weekend.</p>

				<p>Wow. Just, wow. Are you reading my mind, Deb? I just had an idea earlier today: rich chocolate cookies with puffed crispy rice and toasted coconut&#8230; how to incorporate caramel? Any suggestions for the perfect cookie??? Also: do you know of a dairy-free caramel that doesn&#8217;t immediately seize up? I&#8217;ve had no luck before. Thanks!</p>

				<p>What brand of chocolate is your favorite for baking?</p>
<p> I&#8217;d also love to see pics of the failed batches of things. Have you ever considered linking to those? I know this sounds like an odd suggestion, but it can sometimes be so illuminating to compare the perfected product with the failed tries.</p>

				<p>I do something similar with David Lebovitz&#8217;s dry caramel! 1/2 cup sugar melted til caramel-y colored, then toss in 1 tsp or so sea salt, swirl to mix, and then pour onto a baking sheet lined with parchment or a baking liner. Tip the pan around so it spreads thinly, and then when it hardens, just break it up into tiny pieces. I make Baker&#8217;s one-bowl brownies, less the sugar from the caramel, and mix in the caramel right before they go in the oven. DE-LISH! I may have to try this next time&#8230;</p>

				<p>I often make caramel with half and half because I always have it on hand for coffee. It works for me, and a couple of others here also vouched! I have also tried skim milk which works but the caramel isn&#8217;t nearly as rich. To accommodate a dairy allergy I have also made a caramel sauce with almond milk. It needed continuous stirring and was very thin (the color was also a bit different, much lighter,  even after my first attempt when I cooked it WAY too long)</p>

				<p>Anhar &#8212; I really like Maldon. Not sure where you are, thus, where you can buy it but in NYC, it&#8217;s available a lot of places, from Whole Foods to other grocery stores. It can also be ordered online.</p>
<p>ATG &#8212; I don&#8217;t always take photos. (When I do, I usually share them.) Sometimes I&#8217;m just trying out &#8220;theories&#8221; in the kitchen to see what will happen and I come back to them with the camera out when I&#8217;m more confident I&#8217;ll get it right.</p>
<p>Chocolate brands &#8212; I love Valrhona (who doesn&#8217;t?) but tend to most frequently use a mix of Scharffen-Berger (for unsweetened) and Guittard. Guittard is harder to find, but worth seeking out. I&#8217;m totally into their baking discs (&#8220;wafers,&#8221; they call them, but like 3/4-inch flat chocolate chips, so they melt well but can be coarsely chopped when you want something closer to chocolate chips) and keep them around in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006R8XG5U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B006R8XG5U&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=smitten-20" rel="nofollow">all varieties</a>. I think the 1# boxes list for $12, but I get them for $10 from Fresh Direct in NYC, which I think is a pretty great value for excellent baking chocolate.  </p>

				<p>I baked these immediately after reading&#8230; Never made homemade caramel before and am surprised at how easy it is to make! The caramel didn&#8217;t harden like yours did but still insanely good in the brownies! I love how rich and chocolatey these are&#8230; We had a small square each with red wine&#8230; It was just perfect! Folks, don&#8217;t wait for valentine&#8217;s day to make this!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb! Have you ever tried using nonstick (coated) foil instead of bothering with greasing parchment paper? Much easier, nothing sticks to the stuff, plus it molds nicely to the container, unlike paper. Try it, I think you&#8217;ll be sold.</p>

				<p>Reading this recipe made me realize the thing I miss most in your (otherwise yummylicious) book: your great step-by-step photos! Not that they are exactly necessary (your instructions are always clear), but they help me soooooo much whenever I feel insecure at any given step (&#8220;Oh my God, am I doing this right?&#8221;).</p>
<p>Anyway, this recipe? Must-make-this-weekend. :)</p>

				<p>And you do it again, Deb! Every time.</p>
<p>I recently made some dark chocolate salted caramels for my partner, and to make the caramel I used sugar &amp; water, which i set over a heat and didn&#8217;t stir until it was a nice dark amber, and then added double cream while stirring maniacally and praying to leave this sugar experiment without burn marks. This is a caramel recipe I&#8217;ve used in the past and I know it sets into soft candies, so I simply amped up the amount of double cream to get it a bit runnier.</p>
<p>Butter didn&#8217;t feature in my caramel recipe&#8230; am I doing it wrong? Am I doing it &#8216;not-wrong-per-se, but&#8230; did-you-hear-butter-makes-things-better&#8217;? Or are there simply a variety of ways to make caramel?</p>

				<p>Deb!<br />
I, too, will be making these.  Soon.  But I was wondering whether you had any temperature guide for making the caramel?  I find that when I try to make caramel visually, I take it too far and end up with over &#8211; um &#8211; caramelization.<br />
Thanks.</p>

				<p>Deb, I wanted to answer the question someone asked about using margarine instead of butter.  I have made your Apple Cider Caramels using margarine AND full fat coconut milk, instead of the heavy cream, to make them dairy free.  They were FABULOUS.  In a side by side comparison with ones made with butter and heavy cream, we couldn&#8217;t tell the difference.  My son has multiple food allergies so ingredient substitution is something I do a lot of.  Hope this helps.</p>

				<p>For those who don&#8217;t like buying cream that you won&#8217;t use all of:  David Lebovitz recommended freezing it a few months ago: <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2012/10/can-i-freeze-cream-heavy-whipping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2012/10/can-i-freeze-cream-heavy-whipping/</a> .

				<p>These look insanely delicious!  I must try these.  My husband hates desserts, but can polish off half a tray of brownies in one sitting.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll confess that every time I make homemade brownies, they just never compare to a box of ghirardelli brownie mix.  I&#8217;ve probably just never used a good recipe, or maybe my brownie skills just suck.  Anyway, I&#8217;m definitely giving these a whirl.  Thank you.</p>

				<p>What makes these extra good is that they are not TOO sweet. So when I added chopped pecans and used them to make turtle brownie sundaes, they harmonized well with the ice cream, hot fudge, and whipped cream (the same whipped cream as in your icebox cake). Another great recipe, Deb!</p>

				<p>Echoing the disbelief and mild horror over so many recipes calling for store-bought caramels. On some level, it seems like it&#8217;d be more trouble to try to track down a jar or box of them than to just make them myself &#8211; and if I&#8217;m going to make brownies, I might as well not hold back.</p>

				<p>I am 4 months pregnant and craving those brownies&#8230;who am I kidding? I would eat those ANYTIME! Instead of cutting the caramel into squares and integrating into the batter, I am going to try layering the caramel &#8220;sheet&#8221; in between the chocolate. Really get that layered effect in each bite. Thinking maybe it won&#8217;t cut so well???</p>

				<p>I used regular salt and whole milk in a pinch and they turned out great.   (I would never sub margarine for butter though&#8230; unless there is a food allergy)   Margarine is worse for you than butter and doesn&#8217;t taste nearly as good<br />

				<p>Deb, thanks for this. My husband&#8217;s all-time favorite dessert is a salty caramel cupcake from Sprinkes, with brownie sundae in a close second. I tried making salted caramel brownies (his two fav things in one dessert) for his birthday last year but it was sort of a flop. The gooey caramel didn&#8217;t mesh well with the the brownie batter and I&#8217;m sure looked like one of first attempts that you had. This year for his bday I will be making YOUR salted caramel brownies, which so much more promise of success. Thanks!</p>

				<p>OK, I am definitely going to make these for one of my best friends who is having surgery Monday.  In know these will cheer her immensely!</p>
<p>BTW for all those light cream, half and half questions, here is your answer: you must use heavy cream, the lower fat options have too much water, and will not make caramel!</p>

				<p>Made these last night! SO SO delicious! One tip, be careful when melting your sugar. my first time I made the caramel with burnt sugar and it was awful. I suggest melting it over low-medium heat and if it looks darker than a golden coppery color, it&#8217;s probably burnt!</p>

				<p>Given the blizzard bearing down on us now, your timing is exquisite.<br />
I for one will NOT be peeling chickpeas but making caramel is another matter entirely.</p>

				<p>@ Carole #203, try substituting the darkest chocolate you can find.  85% cacoa would probably work fine and add only a very little sweetness.  Or use your favorite brownie recipe with the caramels.</p>

				<p>I only came by on this blizzardy day for the pizza dough recipe, but here I am knee deep in gorgeous photos of caramel brownies! My teeth hurt just looking at them! Thanks for the inspiration; if our power stays on, these are on the &#8220;to bake&#8221; list for this weekend!</p>

				<p>Hi Carole &#8211; I&#8217;m in Germany and have found 95% chocolate from Lindt.  Or, you can use semi-sweet (75-85%) and adjust the sugar accordingly &#8211; Deb&#8217;s Heart of Darkness (or something like that) brownies are essentially that recipe.</p>

				<p>Some have said you can make this caramel with a lower fat dairy than heavy cream. I haven&#8217;t made this one (but will soon!) but have ruined on two separate occasions a pot of caramel when the half and half curdled and caused a grainy mess. Remaking it the same day with cream resulted in luscious caramel and no curdling both times. I guess there isn&#8217;t enough fat to keep the proteins from coagulating when it&#8217;s added to a really hot sugar syrup. Heavy cream has never ruined anything. I mean, its basically liquid butter so how could it? </p>
<p>(BTW I&#8217;ve read your blog for years (YEARS!) but never commented. For once, I guess I felt I had something to add.)</p>

				<p>these are so incredibly delicious and beautiful! i am relatively new to your site but i&#8217;m already a huge fan. everything i&#8217;ve made has been perfect! carrot soup with chickpeas and hummus, hummus, challah, and now these. i better start checking out your veggie recipes&#8230;<br />
i&#8217;ve never made caramel before- anyone have any suggestions for how to clean the pot and spoon that has caramel hardened on it? they&#8217;ve been soaking for a while now.</p>

				<p>There are two options on what I can do with this recipe.  Show it my wife, eat some of these amazing brownies and then feel regret over breaking my diet.  Or I can not show it to her go eat a carrot and then regret not showing the recipe to her.</p>
<p>Well since there&#8217;s going to be regret either way I might was well have a brownie or two&#8230;</p>

				<p>I agree with Charm. Making caramel without a temperature is flying blind in my book. There are so many things that affect the perception of color (lighting, pan color, etc) that I refuse to make any caramel recipe without a candy thermometer.<br />
Maybe I&#8217;ll make a different caramel recipe and then add it to the brownies the way you did.</p>

				<p>This recipe can be more easily made by using Ghirardelli Brownie Mix, spreading half of the mixture in the pan, top with good caramel candies sliced on top, then top off<br />
with remaining brownie mix.  Bake according to package directions.  While brownies<br />
are cooling, spread Trader Joe&#8217;s Fleur de Sel Caramel Sauce on top and a sprinkle of<br />
fleur de sel salt.  Delicious and decadent.  Try it!</p>

				<p>Amazing!  I think I actually followed the recipe on this one with just one exception, I used semi-sweet choc squares.  I think the sweetness was just right for us, but we prefer things on the sweeter side.  I even cut them with a heart shaped cookie cutter.  Super fun and so perfect for our snow day today!

				<p>I was at The BookShop on West Portal (in San Francisco) this morning.  Guess what?????  I saw your book RIGHT NEXT to Ina Garten&#8217;s latest cookbook.  You&#8217;ll be happy to know it was in a prominent place on a table near the cashier.  I was soooo happy for you I practically jumped up and down.  I had my hands full, plus purse and dog and was in a rush or I&#8217;d have picked it up, written a note and slipped it in.  I have to go back.  My note will say:  &#8220;Buy this book!  Deb is a wonderful, creative cook, her writing keeps me reading her blog everyday.  You&#8217;ll thank me.&#8221;  Anything you&#8217;d like to add?</p>

				<p>Help!  I just finished the recipe, but all of the carmel (which turned out perfectly) sunk to the bottom of the batter mix including the carmels I scattered on the top.  When I cut into them, they&#8217;re like a brownie with a carmel layer on the bottom.  Any idea what I should do different next time?  And, they only took 20 minutes in the oven until the toothpick came out clean.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t usually like brownies – too sweet and gooey, and they remind me of adolescence. But your preamble won me over, and I made these today. They are positively life-changing.<br />
Next time (tomorrow?) I may try them with toasted pecans, as somebody suggested.<br />
Thank you!</p>

				<p>Made these today, an epic fail. Carmel did not harden, I finally rolled it into small balls and put in my chest freezer for an hour and they were still soft and gooey. The carmel melted and made little sink holes in the brownies, they fell apart when I cut them. They tasted alright but not worth the time and ingredients. Luckily 16 year old boys will eat anything.</p>

				<p>I just made these. I had to&#8211;it&#8217;s snowy and windy, and what else can I do when a recipe calling for salted caramel comes my way? But I had no heavy cream in the house, so I used a mixture of half melted butter and half low fat milk for the salted caramel. It seems to have worked! The brownies are still warm, so it remains to be seen how they cool, but warm they are aamaaazing.</p>

				<p>Thanks Deb.  We&#8217;re gonna try these.  Last weekend we made the Pioneer Woman&#8217;s caramel brownies because I made the mistake of sendng it to my daughter with the title &#8216;Diabetic Coma&#8217;.  They had SO MUCH caramel that our teeth DID ache, we could only eat them in 1&#8243; squares and we made everyone who walked in the house take some home.  We LOVE caramel brownies and this looks &#8216;lighter&#8217;.</p>

				<p>I left this page open on my computer and my kids went nuts when they wandered over to see the pics! &#8220;PLEASE, PLEASE MOMMY, MAKE THESE!!&#8221; I indulged them tonight and these totally lived up to the hype.  Ah-MAZING.  I followed recipe and with the addition of roasted, salted pecans.  </p>
<p>Note: When making caramel, after I added in the cream and butter, I bought it back to a boil just for a minute or two. The caramel was very, very soft and hard to h<br />
handle. Be sure to cook it a good bit after the butter/cream addition.</p>
<p>Stellar recipe!</p>

				<p>Made these tonight w/hersheys deep dark cocoa powder and oil .. also didn&#8217;t let my caramel firm up long enough (call me pregnant and impatient) so a bunch disappeared as I folded it in .. leaving me to wonder .. could I pour my batter into my pan, maybe half first, poke in some caramels, top the other half of my batter in, poke in some caramels? Hmm&#8230; a great excuse to make another batch for another day. These are amazing. Thank you &lt;3</p>

				<p>DON&#8217;T eat them you say? For my own good? Well now I have no other option but to make them straight away and not share them with the five other people in my house.<br />

				<p>Absolutely perfect! I added a bit of orange zest, as I love the combination of orange and chocolate. I made them for a movie night with friends and they were gone in minutes! A big Thank You send from Germany!</p>

				<p>ONLY bad thing about this recipe is that it doesn&#8217;t make enough! It was so delicious that i&#8217;m making another batch immediately after finishing the first one! so good!!</p>

				<p>Hurray!  Thank you above commenters for all the advice because now I can make these with substituting half and half for cream and cocoa powder+oil for unsweetened chocolate while Boston digs itself out from under Nemo.</p>

				<p>Well, for the record, when you misread &#8217;4 Tbs butter&#8217; as &#8217;4oz butter&#8217; for the caramel, it doesn&#8217;t work all that well. Doubling the butter resulted in a caramel that did harden, but needless to say it was rather thin, and the caramels in the brownie batter disappeared entirely while those on the top hardened&#8230; Too bad, I&#8217;ll just have to try again soon. The brownies themselves are delicious. </p>
<p>Who decided butter should be measured in tablespoons, anyway??</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m snowed in with plans for cooking and baking up a storm (no pun intended). I swung on over to Smitten Kitchen to cross check an apple pie recipe and I was stopped by this recipe. Now my plans include three pies, cinnamon buns, marshmallows, cookies and these brownies. I have no will power when it comes to caramel.</p>
